My name is Jiahao, and I'm currently a Product Manager at Kiteworks. I graduated from UCLA in 2022 with a Mathematics/Computer Science and Business Economics double major and a minor in Statistics.
                      
I've worked across the insurance, fintech, and technology industries and subsequently developed a passion for using technology to solve the most pressing problems facing businesses today. I'm grateful that the skills I've learned professionally and in school—including AB experimentation, full-stack development, data analysis, and machine learning—have equipped me with a unique skillset that is applicable to any situation. Today, I'm happy to blend my technical and soft skills as a Product Manager.

In my free time, I like to lift weights, swim, bike, run and cook large, hearty meals. I've also been learning how to play the guitar (Best Part by Daniel Caesar is a classic😉) and learning MMA. I'm also interested in investing, and am working towards the goal of building my own company someday. Let's connect!
