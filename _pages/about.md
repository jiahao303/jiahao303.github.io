I'm Jiahao, and I'm currently a Product Manager on Microsoft Teams. I graduated from UCLA in 2022 with a Mathematics/Computer Science and Business Economics double major and a minor in Statistics.
                      
I've worked across the insurance, fintech, and 
technology industries and subsequently developed a 
passion for using data to solve the most pressing
problems facing businesses today."
